# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Compliance, Analytics, and Finalize Email Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement GDPR/US privacy compliance: cookie consent banner (custom JS or GTM-based) blocking non-essential cookies until approval. Update legal pages (REQ-WEB-112). Integrate Google Tag Manager for GA4 & pixels. Configure SendGrid for any remaining transactional emails.
# Details:
# Cookie Consent Banner (vanilla JS in main.js or via GTM):
# - Display banner on first visit. Options: Accept All, Reject Non-Essential, Preferences.
# - Store consent in localStorage.
# - Conditionally load GTM or specific tags based on consent.
# - Example: `if(localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent') === 'accepted') { // load GTM }`

# Legal Pages (privacy.php, terms.php, cookies.php - REQ-WEB-112):
# - Review and finalize content detailing data practices, cookie usage, EU storage (if applicable), user rights.

# Google Tag Manager (GTM) Setup:
# - Add GTM container snippet to all pages (e.g., in includes/header.php), respecting consent.
# - Configure GA4 tag in GTM. Configure other marketing pixels (e.g., Facebook) in GTM, ensuring they fire based on consent status.
# - Ensure UTM tracking can be captured by GA4.

# SendGrid (PHP API):
# - Confirm all transactional emails (registration, contact forms, password reset if implemented) use SendGrid.
# - Ensure marketing email opt-ins (e.g., from resource downloads) are correctly managed (e.g., adding to a specific SendGrid marketing list).

# Test Strategy:
Verify cookie banner functions (blocks/allows scripts based on choice). Check GTM loads, GA4/pixels fire per consent. Review legal pages. Test all transactional emails. Verify marketing opt-in process.
