# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project environment, set up the Git repository on GitHub (`web_crm_code_workspace`), and create the basic HTML files (`index.php`, `about.php`, etc.) with common header, footer, and navigation elements. This includes setting up the local development environment (MAMP/XAMPP/WAMP).
# Details:
# Initialize Git repository

git remote add origin <repository_url_for_web_crm_code_workspace>

# Create project directory structure
mkdir public
mkdir public/assets
mkdir public/assets/css
mkdir public/assets/js
mkdir src # For PHP backend logic or keep PHP files in root

# Create basic PHP files for pages (e.g., index.php, about.php, product.php, pricing.php, blog.php, resources.php, docs.php, community.php, contact.php, investors.php, privacy.php, terms.php, cookies.php)
# Each file should include:
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html lang="en">
# <head>
#   <meta charset="UTF-8">
#   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
#   <title>Omnipotency.ai - [Page Title]</title>
#   <link rel="stylesheet" href="public/assets/css/style.css">
# </head>
# <body>
#   <?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>
#   <main><!-- Page specific content --></main>
#   <?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
#   <script src="public/assets/js/main.js"></script>
# </body>
# </html>
# Create includes/header.php and includes/footer.php for common elements.
